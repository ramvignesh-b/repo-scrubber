                    <p class="lead">I was a typical GitHub user, forking all the cool repos I came across and dumping all my projects to GitHub <i>(even when I knew nothing about Git commands).</i> When I finally decided to follow the industry-level best-practices, I wanted to start by cleaning my workspace of all the dumps and forks that I had never worked on or contributed to, and I knew that manually deleting a repo from GitHub is time-consuming and tedious.
                    After rummaging through the endless articles and forums, I found a few people who figured out a way to delete repo from the comfort of bash shell. Eventhough it gets the job done without having to <mark>type the repo name into the input field for confirming the deletion</mark>, something felt off on user-perspective ü§î.
                    That's when I decided to implement a similar logic in a web application, but this time add the option to delete multiple repo <mark>in just a few clicks</mark>, with a hassle free user experience üòÄ. Thanks to this project, I got hands dirty on Bootstrap 5 <i>(which I have been wanting to, for a really long time)</i> and refreshed my Angular skillset.üôÇ</p>

                        Disclaimer -- currently <mark>you cannot use this tool to delete private repo</mark>. As for the future development, I may or may not be adding tiny details and additional features, like powerful filters -- based on activity, date, organisation etc -- and probably other user controls. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/ramvignesh-b/repo-scrubber" target="_blank">fork the repo</a> and make contributions. üôÇ
