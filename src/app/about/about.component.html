                        <p class="lead">I was a typical GitHub user, forking all the cool repos I came across and
                            dumping all my projects to GitHub 😅 <i>(even when I knew nothing about Git commands).</i>
                            When
                            I finally decided to follow the industry-level best-practices, I wanted to start by cleaning
                            my workspace of all the dumps and forks that I had never worked on or contributed to, and I
                            knew that <mark>manually deleting a repo from GitHub is time-consuming and tedious.</mark>
                            After rummaging through the endless articles and forums, I found a few people who figured
                            out a way to delete repo from the comfort of shell scripts. Eventhough it gets the job done
                            without having to <i>'type the repo name into the input field for confirming the
                                deletion'</i>, something felt off on user-perspective. 🤔
                            That's when I decided to implement a similar logic in a web application, but this time add
                            the functionality to delete <mark>multiple repos</mark> in just a few clicks, with a hassle
                            free
                            user experience. 😀

                            Thanks to this project, I got hands dirty on Bootstrap 5 <i>(which I
                                have been wanting to, for a really long time)</i> and renewed my Angular skillset.🙂
